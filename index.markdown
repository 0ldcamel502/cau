# Bill's Tutorial
---


  
    
      

I followed [Bill Raymond's video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKB9ylw0G4U) and have everything working. You can find all the commands [here](https://github.com/BillRaymond/install-jekyll-apple-silicon). I prefer typing them myself but it's a good source for reference.

If you upload it to GitHub, remember to update the `_config.yml`:

- url: `<your-GitHub-usernam.github.io>`
- base url: your repo

I wish Bill would take time to update the instruction (the markdown file, not the video) to include instructions for updating Ruby to version 3.1
